# COSUST_examples

This repository provides an overview of different applications of complexity metrics in sustainability sciences. 
The interested reader is referred to the publication: Mallinger K., Raubitzek S., Neubauer T. & Lade S. (2024): Potentials and limitations of complexity research in Farming 4.0. â€“ Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability.

The structure of the respository follows the following application fields:
* 4.1. Complexity and Reconstructed Phase Spaces to Improve the Architecture of the Employed Algorithm
* 4.2. Complexity Metrics as Additional Features for Machine Learning Algorithms
* 4.3. Complexity Metrics to find Regions of Increased Predictability
* 4.4. Feature Selection and Improvement Using Complexity and Reconstructed Phase Spaces
* 4.5. Filtering Predictions/Ensembles Using Complexity and Reconstructed Phase Spaces

## Installation Guide
We provided a .yml file (COSUST.yml) that contains all packages needed to run the individual scripts. To install it, use Anaconda (or something similar like Miniconda) and create new environment using the COSUST.yml file. To do so, go to the repository directory and create new environment, using the command "conda env create -f COSUST.yml". Activate this environment and you are good to go.
